# MPI_GEVP
A FORTRAN 90+ program for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem on distributed computers.
This distribution consists of two files, the distribution itself, which is

MPI_GEVP_Package.tar.gz, and a HowTo, which is
HowTo_MPI_GEVP_inviter.pdf
Download both files and follow the instructions in the HowTo to compile the solver
and another program for generating Matrix elements for testing it. Output files for
the tests described in the HowTo are also provided in the distribution.
